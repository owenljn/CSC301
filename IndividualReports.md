## Name Li Wan(martylee)



* My most significant contribution was the implementation of the front side of this android app, including the UI design. I have created a well-designed interface and uploaded it to the Github. The demo is developed by Angular JS.
* While working on our Android app , I learned how to build the connection between a frontend mobile app and a backend server with the database for this app. I also got experienced with the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) system, we use it to send message to the android  device.
* Since I have some knowledge of the Android development,  I gave advice to our team members for the android coding. Meanwhile, I helped to test the server side of this project, debugging the android Java code.
* I only have a few commit to the github, since I always do my work locally and forgot to submit the code to the git.



## Name Lingfei Gao(hob19930414)

----
* My most significant contribution was the implementation of backend database by helping Owen(from 551e563 to 4121152) and front android add/edit/delete event function with Timothy and Matthew(under branch dynamic).
* While working on our Android app, I learned about how to make UI of android App and also learned about database for backend(that I haven't learn before). And I also notice that it is really hard to write same android app with different version of program and dependicies.
* I am always trying to help my teammates to test and figured error and also setting up development environment even though I am not experienced for either android and database. I also tried to communicate with all team members in order to  set up meetings(and set up facebook group chat).
* I could insist on changing our project from android to web before phase 2 after figuring out it is really difficult for a team that almost have no experience with Android to do the project. If we swtiched to android, we would not waste hours of time to figure numerous error and problems and make a web application with more funciton. That means I should be more decisive and communicate more with others.





## Name Jinnan Lu(owenljn)
----
* I'm working mostly on the back end. I set up the database and server using Amazon Web Services, also with the help of other members, we created the database schema as well as the php files on server that communicates with both Android devices and database.

* We learned about the GCM aka Google Cloud Messaging services provided by google, we can send encoded JSON messages through GCM thus google can send push notifications to Android devices with given registration ids and apiKey.

* I have previous experices with database management and how to set up a webserver with php files, so I can help work on the problems where other members who haven't taken CSCS343(database) or CSC309(web programming) are having difficulties on.

* I could have get more time to study about Android programming so I can contribute more on the front end too.




## Name Alina Gvozdik (a-gvo)

* My most significant contribution was to the implementation of the front-end android application. Some of the more interesting and challenging work involved separating the add/update/delete activities into separate fragments (commit https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team6-repo/commit/b3de7e20b39b648d2ee8c54ba7c7a6517a6f2cf3), as there were several communication and implementation challenges that were new, and required a lot of research.
* While working on the Android application, I learned quite a lot about Activities, fragments, and how they interact with one another. There were also several design challenges, so there was a lot of experimentation with the resource files. For example, some changes in design from (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team6-repo/commit/7993bdcc853d1d77fc897c4fa042745d4eb3d9c0) to (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team6-repo/commit/55e86022898ce54299f80b511ce957faf1234e6b).
* My main strength on this project was my previous Android programming experience. Even though I was working with unfamiliar API, it was easier to grasp new concepts. I was also familiar with tools such as the Jackson library for JSON.
* Sometimes it’s difficult for me to judge the scope of work for a programming project, resulting in bad time management and planning. For example, it was my suggestion to have the entire team work on the Android application for phase 2 (due to it being the most easily demo-able component), when work could have been done more efficiently by splitting the team into back-end and front-end groups from the beginning.


## Name Matthew Lei(matlife)

----
* Most significant contribution: Backend development with creation of the function used to connect to the web server and database to execute specific php files under dynamic branch (7fc94a3df55fef5c6d7635b92b637e117776c103), front end management under the same branch with Lingfei and Timothy
* I learned a lot about android development, and web servers with database connections. The nuances in each medium are certainly strange at first, and adaptation was a must to get things done
* I have strengths in databases(CSC343, CSC309), so I developed the schema with Timothy, and enjoy swimming in code and developing algorithms, so naturally I worked in the back end team. 
* My experience with android development and remote web servers was rudimentary. It was extremely difficult to learn how to even import code with the right dependencies and source files -- you could say that I started to run (aimed extremely high in our first phase) before I learned how to crawl (I couldn’t even set up my environment!).


## Kexin Zhang (kathyzhang)

* My most significant contribution was server side implementation and testing. I helped implementing server side receiving user request to create event, delete event, update and sending push notifications.

* I learned so much from this project and it is hard to pick one. I learned about Android UI, google cloud messaging, php, database and adaption. I learned how local app communicates with server and how sever save and modify user information in database. 

* I helped figuring out solutions and find bugs. We are more efficient when working together.

* I wish I could have chosen to take database and programming on the web before taking this course because both of these two courses are very essential for this project. I need to spend a lot of time to learn it to catch up with the team. Thanks to my teammates helped me a lot when I had trouble catching up with them.
