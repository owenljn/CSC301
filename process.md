For our project, aside from meeting every Thursday in tutorial, we had weekly scrum meetings at the laptop lounge at Bahen Center. Before each sprint, we would all meet as a team and discuss the plan for the next sprint and would decide how to split up the tasks. We used a google doc to document all matters that we discussed during the sprint meetings and how we would split up the work for the next sprint. We would also decide as a group, the frameworks we would use, such as using Android, Google Cloud and Tomcat for our project. At the end of each assigned sprint, we would meet up together and discuss what each member had contributed and decide what to do for the next sprint using the same process.

After planning and delegating tasks, each group would work on their assigned tasks during the sprint. Within each sprint, each individual group closely communicated with each other and met up frequently to work together and discuss with each other. Whenever a larger problem would arise, a member would bring up that issue to the entire group and we would brainstorm ideas to resolve the issue. For example, when we discovered an error causing our program to terminate immediately, the entire group met up to resolve the problem together. Overall, we would always plan everything out carefully, stick to the plan and meet up as a group after each sprint. In the end, we were not able to implement notifications for this phase, but have a working prototype which can store and display events.

For this project, we did not focus as much on using the GitHub issue management system as much as we did in the exercise. We did not use it as prevalently to split up the tasks but we used it to bring up major errors. This was actually a poor decision because we found, from the exercise, that the issue system was a very effective way to organize each memberâ€™s tasks. However, after each issue was raised, although we did not use it often, the entire group would be immediately aware of the bug and we would all work to fix it, and as stated above, would even strive to meet up. 

Major decisions????
