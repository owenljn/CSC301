Phase 3 Report
 
During phase 2, we divided the work into several tasks that would eventually need to be integrated with each other. For example, our main task for Phase 2 was to receive push notifications from Google cloud, and to translate that information into events that would be displayed on our calendar. The second task was to create an interface for creating new events. Finally, the last task was to create an interface for date and time input for the event. These three different prototypes are actually three distinct aspects of our MVP and will easily fit together to form one final product.

By the end of phase 4, we plan to have the above 3 aspects integrated into one prototype. This would provide functionality for adding, removing and updating events in a remote database using the interface. After one full phase of development, we see that our product may differ from our initial design. In our MVP, we also state that we plan to have an account system, a way to add your school schedule, notifications when an event is approaching and suggestions for how to use free time. As of phase 3, we have two teams currently working on integrating 3 parts of phase 2 and setting up the server and database. 
 
We have started to create an account system in the database but have yet to implement the ability to login and signup. Since we are using one central database to store every single user and every single event, it would be vital to create an account system to know which events a user has. We do not plan to exclude the account system from our MVP. Next, it was also mentioned that we would have our school schedule automatically added to the task manager but we had quickly decided that this was of low priority and would only be handled if we had extra time. After prioritizing all our other functionalities, we decided that it would suffice for the MVP to just have students manually add classes and as a result, we will be focusing more on this alternative instead. As for notifications, we have not entirely figured out how we are planning to implement this feature. We plan to have notifications sent to the user whenever an event was approaching. However, within our team, there is much confusion regarding how to exactly implement notifications. As a result, we have yet to start developing this feature. Regardless, we agree that we need to implement the server first, before any notifications can be sent so we plan to meet up and discuss notifications as a team before we start to implement it. We are still planning to keep this feature in our MVP. Lastly, we believed that having a “task suggester” would help users make better use of their free time. We originally planned to have the application examine free spaces in a user’s schedule and their upcoming deadlines and suggest times to study or work. We have not yet discussed whether or not we will keep this function but definitely agree that it would be useful for users. If we are to cut this functionality, it would be due to a lack of time considering the amount of other work we are still responsible for doing. Overall, we want to include as much functionality as possible in our final design.
 
One unanticipated addition to our original design was the decision to make use of the Jackson library for parsing and creating JSON strings. As we discovered, the built in Android function for this proved to be quite primitive, requiring a lot of coding on our part in order to serialize/deserialize objects. As this could result in bugs that could easily be avoided by making use of something more effective, we proceeded to research other available options. As the Jackson library proved to be the easiest to use - requiring only a few lines of code - we decided to include it in our project.
 
We face many problems while working on the project. One of the main problems that we faced as a team was configuring the Android project on everyone’s IDE. We found that although the code would compile properly on one member’s computer, when another member tried to import the code, they would receive unexpected errors. Since it was an ongoing issue that we had a lot of trouble with, we were forced to meet frequently and as a result, had to complete the majority of the work in phase 2 during our team meetings. When dividing the work up, we assigned tasks to groups of team members and we would do much of our work together in our smaller teams. In this way, we did not have to immediately handle sharing our code with each other. As a result, we developed 3 separate prototypes (mentioned above) in separate teams and are working to integrate them into one final prototype.
 
The second problem that we faced as a team was our lack of experience in Android programming. It proved to be quite different from typical Java programming, with its own unique rules and challenges. Accessing layout elements outside of the core activity, for example, proved to be not as intuitive as we originally thought. It took extensive research and experimentation to come up with a solution - passing the activity instead of the context as a parameter, and using it to access the layout elements.
 
There are several design patterns in our project: Singleton, DAO, and Observer are the ones that could be noted. The Singleton design pattern was used in our CalendarMonthConstructor class. This will result in there being only one copy of the calendar constructor. This will become necessary in the future when the functionality for integrating several calendars will be added, as such integration will be the responsibility of that one class. The observer design pattern is perfectly illustrated by the GcmBroadcastReceiver class. The receiver observes any updates from the Google cloud, and passes that information to all the relevant classes. Finally the DAO design pattern will be used in our server, hiding the specifics of database access from the other classes.

One of the main challenges that we are currently facing is the full implementation of the server. We anticipate that there will be some additional work with respect to learning how to use the Tomcat application server to parse requests from our Android application, as well as how our server will interact with the Google cloud in order to send push notifications to our mobile users. To combat this new challenge we have dedicated four of our group members to ensure a successful implementation of the server. For our current progress, we have created an initial database that is connected to a server. Up until now, we faced some unexpected challenges with Tomcat and Google cloud and are working to integrate these into our server. Moving forward, we plan to have the server be able to receive requests from a client to add, remove or update events in the database and hopefully have the server send notifications to users when one of their events is approaching.
