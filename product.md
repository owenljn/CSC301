For our project we have decided to create a time management application on Android. As of phase 2, we have not completed all the required MVP specifications, but have created a functional prototype. Our application shows a calendar that holds all of the usersâ€™ events that have been inputted. When the user clicks on a specific day of the calendar, they will be able to see all the events they have during that day. When the user sees an event, they will be able to see the date and time of the event and the description that they have inputted. They will also be able to delete any events that they do not want and will be able to edit any previously entered events. Once a user updates or adds an event, the event will also be automatically placed into the correct day of the month on the calendar so the user can see what events they have coming up.
