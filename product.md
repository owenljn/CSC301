		Three prototypes were created in phase 2, to provide easier debugging and handling of code as well as platform issues. Since the application's 'business end' is handled mainly by the not yet implemented server, we chose to implement the important features separately. The fusion of the prototypes was planned to be executed in parallel with the server development


		In phase 2, we had not completed all the required MVP specifications, but have implemented basic functionality amongst our three prototypes. The first prototype showed a calendar that holds all of the usersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ events that have been inputted. When the user clicks on a specific day of the calendar, they will be able to see all the events they have during that day. If a particular day contains an event, then the cell will be coloured to indicate that there is an event. This prototype receives events from an imitated server and parses the JSON objects into events, and places them into the correct dates. Our next prototypes shows how we will be able to add and remove events. We have a button that allows users to input an event, and for now, it is shown in a list format. Once an event is created, it can also be removed and edited with a click of a button.The final prototype is similar to the second one, but provides a Ã¢â‚¬Å“date pickerÃ¢â‚¬ for users to easily select a date, rather than input the date. It also shows a menu bar and a log in system that we will definitely be implementing in later phases of the assignment. It also provides a search window as well as a web interface.
		
		
		With the three prototypes we developed and demoed in phase 2, we developed the final product. The product we created this phase is comprised of two parts: a front-end android mobile client application, and a back end remote web server and database. The front end mobile client handles a multitude of features. It begins the first steps of creating, updating, and deleting events by retrieving the appropriate information to do so. The application then sends the information to a remote server which handles the back end. The client eventually receives a push notification which confirms the completion of the event. The back end server is accessed through HTTP posts which open and execute php files.
